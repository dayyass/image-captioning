### Image Captioning

My solution to the **Image Captioning Final Project** of the [*Introduction to Deep Learning*](https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-to-deep-learning) course in the [*Advanced Machine Learning*](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aml) specialization on Coursera.

Trained model is also deployed as a [telegram bot](https://t.me/dayyass_image_captioning_bot), so you have the opportunity to play with it.<br/>
Despite the fact that the model is not of the best quality, it is good just for fun :)

### About

**Image Captioning** is the process of generating textual description of an image.<br/>
It uses both **Computer Vision** and **Natural Language Processing** to generate the captions.
